SHORT NOTES ON  BASIC JS/PHP

#JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used client-side to dynamically script webpages whereas PHP is a server-side scripting language for building web apps and dynamic websites.


#Common Data Types in Both Languages are:

String - "I love programming"
Numbers - 2017
Boolean - true/false

*JavaScript also has the types Objects and Date.



#Arrays:

var primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37];

var multidimensionalArray = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

var myArray = new Array(45 , "Hello World!" , true , 3.2);

*Accessing objects can be done by specifying their index with a [] after the array name e.g. myArray[1] would give "Hello World!".


#Creating Variables in:

JS: 
var name = "Chuck Norris";

PHP:
$name = "Chuck Norris";

#Note: ; - is used to end a line and {} is used for function/loop/conditional scopes in both JS and PHP.

*Although Javascript and PHP can retrieve values using various methods from the document(HTML contents), JS can use it's window.prompt object to receive inputs in a dailog box.


#Outputting Object:

In JS, this can be performed using either the console.log(), document.write() or window.alert() while in PHP you use the echo or print statements.


#Comparison Operators:

x === y // returns true if two things are equal
x !== y // returns true if two things are not equal
x <= y // returns true if x is less than or equal to y
x >= y // returns true if x is greater than or equal to y
x < y // returns true if x is less than y
x > y // returns true if x is greater than y


#Functions

A function is a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.It is like a reusable piece of code. Imagine , having 20 for loops ,and then having a single function to handle it all . To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. A function definition (also called a function declaration) consists of the function keyword, followed by the name of the function, a list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

function greet() {
  return "Hello";
}

The above function can be used for both JS and PHP.


#Sample Conditional Statement

if (condition1) {
  statement1;
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2;
} else {
  statement3;
}


#LOOPS IN JS:
var i;
for (i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
    console.log(i); // Prints the numbers from 10 to 1
}

#LOOPS IN PHP
for ($i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Prints the numbers from 1 to 10
}

*While or Do While Loops could also be used in both languages.
